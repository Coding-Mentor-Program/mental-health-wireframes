# mental-health-wireframes
This is the first group collaboration project after competing as a team in the Girl Develop It 2021 Hackathon. 
This group of female-only coders have banded together to learn, grow, and work with each other through this Mentorship 
Program which was founded and managed by Amber Merritt.


## How to Push/Pull to Repo

You are all set as "Admins" for this repository. All you should have to do is...

1. Clone Repository
Go to the green "Code" button and select HTTPS and copy this. 
  - You can also do the SSH Key one but you'll have to make sure you have the correct credentials in order to do so. 
    (This will just add extra security and cause you to need a key for each "pull/push" request. See [SSH Key How To](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
    but for these directions we'll be doing the HTTPS as its the easiest and we don't need that level of security...*yet oooooooOOoooOOOoooo*
   
2. Open Terminal (either VS Integrated Terminal, which is my personal preference, or standard terminal)

3. Change your current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory. 

4. Type `git clone` and paste the URL HTTPS link you've just copied.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
Press Enter to create your local clone.
```
Will then show this: 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
